Collections of jupyter notebooks working on various datasets. 

## 1. Analysis of apps on Google play store and App Store
[Notebook](https://github.com/amogghrao/Projects-Python/blob/master/Profitable%20apps%20Profiles.ipynb) is intended to serve as a path to understand real world application of python. In this Notebook, our focus will be on the following topics of python(Prior knowledge of following topics is expected):

 - The basics of programming in Python (arithmetical operations, variables, common data types, etc.)
 - List and for loops 
 - Conditional statements
 - Dictionaries and frequency tables
 - Functions
 
 ## 2. Hacker News Exploration
 [Notebook](https://github.com/amogghrao/Projects-Python/blob/master/Hacker%20News%20exploration.ipynb) is a short project to understand datetime module of python. We are comparing two different types of posts from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), a popular site where technology related stories (or 'posts') are voted and commented upon. The two types of posts we'll explore Ask HN or Show HN.

My focus on this projects lies in 

- List and for loops
- Datetime module
- Data Cleaning

## 3. Employee Exit Surveys
[Notebook](https://github.com/amogghrao/Projects-Python/blob/master/Exit%20Survey%20of%20DETE.ipynb) is a short project to understand data cleaning techniques and regular expressions in python. 

We will clean and analyze exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment \(DETE\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland)) and [Technical and Further Education (TAFE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_and_further_education) body of Queensland government in Australia. We can find the TAFE exit survey [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and DETE exit survey [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey).
