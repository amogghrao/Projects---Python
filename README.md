# Projects-Python
Collections of jupyter notebooks working on various datasets. 

## 1. Analysis of apps on Google play store and App Store
[Notebook](https://github.com/amogghrao/Projects-Python-Basics/blob/master/1.%20Profitable%20apps%20Profiles.ipynb) is intended to serve as a path to understand real world application of python. In this Notebook, our focus will be on the following topics of python(Prior knowledge of following topics is expected):

 - The basics of programming in Python (arithmetical operations, variables, common data types, etc.)
 - List and for loops 
 - Conditional statements
 - Dictionaries and frequency tables
 - Functions
 
 ## 2. Hacker News Exploration
 [Notebook](https://github.com/amogghrao/Projects-Python-Basics/blob/master/2.%20Hacker%20News%20exploration.ipynb) is a short project to understand datetime module of python. We are comparing two different types of posts from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), a popular site where technology related stories (or 'posts') are voted and commented upon. The two types of posts we'll explore Ask HN or Show HN.

My focus on this projects lies in 

- List and for loops
- Datetime module
- Data Cleaning

 ## 3.  Exploring eBay Car Sales Data
[Notebook](https://github.com/amogghrao/Projects-Python-Basics/blob/master/3.%20Exploring%20eBay%20Car%20Sales%20Data.ipynb) is a short project to understand basic data cleaning techniques and working with type and date casting. We will be working on a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a [classified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_advertising) section of the German eBay website.

The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database/data). The version of the dataset we are working with is a sample of 50,000 data points.

## 4.  Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94

In this [Notebook](https://github.com/amogghrao/Projects-Python-Basics/blob/master/4.%20%20Finding%20Heavy%20Traffic%20Indicators%20on%20I-94.ipynb), we're going to analyze a dataset about the westbound traffic on the [I-94 Interstate highway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_94).

The goal of our analysis is to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. These indicators can be weather type, time of the day, time of the week, etc. For instance, we may find out that the traffic is usually heavier in the summer or when it snows.

John Hogue made the dataset available that we'll be working with, and you can download it from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume).


## 5.  Storytelling Data Visualization on Exchange Rates

In this [Notebook](https://github.com/amogghrao/Projects-Python-Basics/blob/master/5.%20Storytelling%20Data%20Visualization%20on%20Exchange%20Rates.ipynb) we will focus on **Explanatory** data visualization to create graphs for others to inform, make a point, or tell a story. We will be drawing inspiration directly from [**FiveThrityEight**](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-40-weirdest-and-best-charts-we-made-in-2020/) visualization practices.

The project aims to examine the conversion rates of the Euro to Dollar historically through a data set of Euro conversion rates across multiple countries from the Euro's conception to the beginning of 2021. Then trends across six economically impactful events will be visually represented to see what kind of relationship exists betweent these events and the Euro(€) to Dollar($) exchange rate.

Daria Chemkaeva put together the data set and made it available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lsind18/euro-exchange-daily-rates-19992020) — the data source is the European Central Bank. 

You can use this code to generate proffesional plots like below:
